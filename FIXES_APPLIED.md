# Fixes Applied - Chatbot & Database Issues

## Date: October 20, 2025

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ MongoDB ObjectId Error with Firebase UIDs

**Problem:**
```
CastError: Cast to ObjectId failed for value "qmHG0DvEO9hWY44JsgBpiDNYdXj1" (type string)
at path "userId" for model "Conversation"
```

**Root Cause:**
- The app uses Firebase Authentication with string UIDs
- MongoDB models were expecting ObjectId for userId field
- Mismatch caused conversations to fail when saving

**Solution:**
Updated the following models to use `String` instead of `mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId` for userId:

1. **`src/models/Conversation.js`** (Line 4-8)
   - Changed: `type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId`
   - To: `type: String, // Firebase UID`

2. **`src/models/UserProgress.js`** (Line 4-8)
   - Changed: `type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId`
   - To: `type: String, // Firebase UID`

**Result:**
- ✅ Chatbot conversations now save correctly
- ✅ User progress tracking works with Firebase UIDs
- ✅ No more BSON casting errors

---

### 2. ✅ Incorrect Chatbot URL Redirects

**Problem:**
When users asked the chatbot about features, they were being redirected to wrong/non-existent pages:
- "scholarship opportunities" → `/features/scholarship-finder` (404)
- "find jobs" → `/features/job-search` (404)
- "practice interview" → `/solutions/ai-mock-interview` (404)

**Root Cause:**
Chatbot controller had hardcoded URLs that didn't match actual frontend routes

**Solution:**
Updated `src/controllers/chatbotController.js` with correct URLs:

#### Scholarship Search Fix (Lines 190-193)
```javascript
case 'scholarship.search':
  actionData.redirectTo = '/features/scholarships'; // Was: /features/scholarship-finder
```

#### Job Search Fix (Lines 170-177)
```javascript
case 'job.search':
  actionData.redirectTo = '/features/career-engine'; // Was: /features/job-search
```

#### Mock Interview Fix (Lines 179-182)
```javascript
case 'interview.practice':
  actionData.redirectTo = '/mock-interview'; // Was: /solutions/ai-mock-interview
```

#### Features List Fix (Lines 208-214)
Updated all feature links:
```javascript
{ name: 'Resume Analyzer', path: '/features/resume-analyzer' }     ✅
{ name: 'Job Search', path: '/features/career-engine' }            ✅ Fixed
{ name: 'AI Mentor', path: '/mentor' }                             ✅
{ name: 'Mock Interview', path: '/mock-interview' }                ✅ Fixed
{ name: 'Career Roadmap', path: '/solutions/roadmap' }             ✅
{ name: 'Scholarship Finder', path: '/features/scholarships' }     ✅ Fixed
```

**Result:**
- ✅ All chatbot redirects work correctly
- ✅ Users can navigate to features via natural language
- ✅ No more 404 errors from chatbot links
