## ⏳ Current Issue: NLU Model Training

### The Error

```
NLU model for flow '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000' does not exist.
Please try again after retraining the flow.
```

### Why This Happens

In Dialogflow CX, after creating intents:
1. ✅ Intents are created in the agent (DONE)
2. ⏳ The NLU (Natural Language Understanding) model needs to be trained
3. Training happens automatically but can take **1-5 minutes**

### Current Status

- ✅ All intents created successfully
- ⏳ NLU model is training (automatic, in progress)
- ⏳ Model will be ready in 1-5 minutes

---

## 🔧 Solutions to Fix the Training

### Option 1: Wait for Automatic Training (Recommended)

Dialogflow CX automatically trains the NLU model. Simply:

1. **Wait 2-5 minutes** after running the setup script
2. Test again using:
   ```bash
   node scripts/test-dialogflow.js
   ```
3. Or test via your backend API

### Option 2: Manual Training via Console (Fastest)

1. **Open the Dialogflow Console:**
   ```
   https://dialogflow.cloud.google.com/cx/projects/careercraftai-475216/locations/us-central1/agents/6a0599aa-7167-4535-aac5-c77b5817c04b
   ```

2. **Navigate to:**
   - Click on "Default Start Flow" in the left sidebar
   - Look for any "Train" or "Retrain" button
   - Click it to force immediate training

3. **Alternative Method:**
   - Go to "Manage" → "Intents" in the left menu
   - Check if there's a training status indicator
   - If it says "Training in progress", just wait
   - If it says "Training required", click "Train"

### Option 3: Trigger Training via API (Advanced)

The training usually happens automatically, but you can also:

1. Make a change to any intent (add/remove a training phrase)
2. Save the intent
3. This will trigger a new training cycle

---

## 🧪 Testing After Training

Once training is complete (2-5 minutes), test with:

### Method 1: Test Script

```bash
node scripts/test-dialogflow.js
```

Expected output:
```
✅ Query: "hello"
   Intent: Default Welcome Intent
   Confidence: 100.0%
   Response: Hello! I'm your AI Career Assistant...
```

### Method 2: Backend API

```bash
# Start backend
npm run dev

# In another terminal, test:
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/chatbot/message \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "hello", "sessionId": "test-123"}'
```

### Method 3: Dialogflow Console

1. Open the agent in the console
2. Use the "Test Agent" panel on the right
3. Type "hello" and press Enter
4. Should see the welcome response

    actionData.redirectTo = '/features/resume-analyzer';
    break;
  // ... other intents
}
```
